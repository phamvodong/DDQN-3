            <h3 style="font-size: 36px;" data-aos="fade-up">Overview</h3>
            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Topic</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">In this project, my team planned on innovating the ergonomic
                chair with the combination of AI technology, making it a unique feature that none other ergonomic chairs
                have. The idea is that we will replicate many of the ergonomic chair models available on the market and
                create a new appearance for our product along with a range of features. The additional features and
                improvements are designed to resolve issues regarding the spine, especially Herniated Disc and
                Scoliosis. To achieve that, my team uses computing methods and machine learning so that it will be able
                to operate efficiently and effortlessly. Next, we cooperate with D'ERGO to manufacture the ergonomic
                chair for the production process. Lastly, the additional adjustment package and the embedded technology
                behind it would be the calculation of investment expenses to minimize as much as possible. Therefore,
                becoming a high-quality product, however, the accomplishment will not be accurate without a significant
                quality assurance process.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Having researched the market, we can state that the
                uniqueness of our ergonomic chair is genuinely incomparable, which can resolve the issue of spine
                problems, especially in young adults. Our product will bring the most comfortable feelings despite hours
                of sitting or occasional movement with different positions. Overall, it will relieve many of users'
                fatigue body parts like the head, neck, and arm, mainly protecting your spine and reducing your lower
                back pain. Therefore, by creating the ergonomic chair, we hope to bring benefits and satisfaction to
                consumers, especially the solution to correct positioning seating. The final stage is to cooperate with
                D'ERGO to produce the product for commercial use. If everything goes according to the plan, we believe
                it becomes a breakthrough in intelligent furniture. Its impact on society will significantly contribute
                since it's a brilliant chair and a supportive healthcare figure.</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Motivation</h4>

            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Our project intends to improve the ergonomic chair includes
                AI technology, to address the issue of Scoliosis mainly happening in the wrong seating position,
                especially in young people. During the Covid – 19 quarantines, people have to study or work remotely.
                Therefore, working with people and students who are not used to sitting for a long time to learn might
                cause back pain and reduce learning motivation. Although ergonomic chairs were widely used among offices
                and home users to address these issues, Scoliosis still exists and is on the rise. Because of the
                pandemic quarantine, students must sit in whatever chair they have to study online. The effectiveness of
                the ergonomic chairs was not enough since children tend to bore or tire with the lecture or sitting for
                an extended period causing back fatigue, and sometimes some children move around or put their leg on the
                table and lean back due to back pain. The AI Ergonomic Chair project was created to resolve spine
                issues, typically Herniated Disc and Scoliosis. My team had integrated AI into our ergonomic chair to
                constantly adjust its back to correspond with the user's back. Like the product, my team used one of the
                latest technology, artificial intelligence. It primarily uses visual assistance similar to Google
                Assistant, Siri, and Alexa. The project's implementation requires teamwork, which includes AI
                development using Python programming, Technical design, and quality assurance. </p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Landscape</h4>

            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">The differentiation within our product compared to others on
                the market is the wide range of adjustments, and the most critical feature is AI integration. Firstly,
                we added the adjustment package, which will provide customers with many adjustable features. Those are
                height and seat depth adjustments; customers can also move around quickly with the independent seat and
                back angles adjustability. Another essential feature of the ergonomic chair is the synchro-tilt
                mechanism which allows the customer to lean back independently with the support of recline function.
                Overall, it will give the customer comfortable seating with an adjustable armrest and headrest, and the
                back will receive the most comfortable feeling, especially the protection of a straight spine. The most
                important feature of our product is the AI integration which will control all the movement
                automatically. The integrated AI is what differentiate our product and others on the market. The AI
                functionality is as it will scan the user's back and control the chair back position to the correct
                shape of the user's back. For example, if the user makes any movement regarding the back, like the seat
                straight, the ergonomic chair will automatically adjust to follow the back's exercise of the user.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 36px;" data-aos="fade-up">Detailed Description</h3>
            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Aims</h4>


            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Our main goal will be considered successful if there is a
                reduction in the number of people who might or will be suffering from scoliosis, especially children.
                Due to the fact that the bone issue regarding the spine is one of the most crucial parts needed for
                early development in children's growth. The benefits of bringing the most comfortable moments in stress
                relief and relaxation on the whole body, especially your back. Additionally, it's known that whenever
                your body feels comfort and joy, people will become energetic in doing things, therefore, increase the
                productivity of working or learning. We hope that our project will positively impact individuals,
                typically office workers and parents, in search of reliable equipment to support their children's online
                study. It is needless to state that it may be considered in the future a scientific invention.

            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Plans and Progress</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">In this project, my teammates and I have planned and
                developed an AI Ergonomic Chair, which we want to help people's spines do not have any bone issues when
                they are old and minimize the risk of scoliosis. My team started this project because it has been famous
                for people in the 4.0 era, mainly because the COVID-19 pandemic makes them work and study at home. That
                is the reason people choose to use AI Ergonomic chairs. They will demonstrate how we approach this
                project and how far we've progressed in AI Ergonomic Chair features and outcomes.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">In the Covid-19 age, people must work from home. That implies
                that some companies are shifting from traditional office work to online labour and using seats that look
                to be trusted co-workers increases the efficiency of online employees. Many young people have confronted
                the spine because they often sit in the wrong posture, especially this problem that happens in children
                aged 10 to 15 years old, both genders are affected equally. Scoliosis has impacted individuals at the
                Covid-19, according to figures from the American Academy of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). This causes
                people to work and study online from home. If this amount is maintained, it will be hazardous to
                people's physical health in the future, particularly for youngsters, who require the highest degree of
                protection possible for their growth and development. The AI Ergonomic Chair project, on the other hand,
                was created to address this issue and protect people's spines.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">According to those problems, our project has improved the
                product to avoid bone issues such as scoliosis, which have increased significantly, and current
                ergonomic chairs are lacking. That means our project needs the bending design of the chair to provide
                complete back support and adjust to maintain a slight backward tilt. Along with adding or removing
                additional elements, they may customize their chairs to suit each body form so that the chair is made of
                net, which absorbs sweat better than canvas, commonly used in chairs. That means our project wants to
                help people feel more comfortable and reduce the likelihood of getting it from the spine or skin, which
                helps us increase productivity. The AI Ergonomic Chair is popular with two types of users: office
                workers and people who have a computer setup such as PewDiePie and employees who use the chair to design
                their room for work or study online. Besides that, we have chosen two stores to sell our products, which
                have a delivery that helps people do online shopping, such as GEARVN and Phong Vu. Hence, we need and
                want development, and we choose technology stores to serve people's lives.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">The AI Ergonomic Chair has several built-in features that
                help people feel more comfortable by detecting the back of their bodies and automatically adjusting to
                fix the proper posture and adapt as their bodies move. These factors indicate that the AI will use the
                sensor to scan the user's body form and determine the ideal chair design for everyone. First, the AI
                will utilize the sensor to track the user's body type and determine which chair design is optimal for
                everyone. If a person has a long back and a broad waist, artificial intelligence will adjust a chair to
                have a long back and a huge seat. Artificial intelligence will also learn the user's sitting form and
                alter the chair's look automatically. Consider a person sitting on a seat cushion with their legs
                crossed; artificial intelligence will expand or develop a little flat in the middle of the leg chair for
                people to rest their feet.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Furthermore, due to the flexible connection with the chair,
                the chair adapts its shape to the activity being done, such as typing, which needs a strange chair,
                reading, which necessitates a soft, sofa-like chair, and gaming, among other things. Those may control
                the AI chair by giving it complete directions, such as moving the seat cushion up and down or playing
                music, because we'll equip it with small speakers on both sides to help people who want to relax while
                listening to music. People may use their phones to operate the chair and do more intricate actions and
                utilize the command by chair app on their phones. As a result of the integration of artificial
                intelligence (AI) with ergonomic chairs, the chair becomes wiser. It's also more suited to respond to
                each customer's posture, offering superior illness prevention. Therefore, innovation and solutions for
                our project can develop our products to serve people who want to have a better life.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">We believe that many ordinary folding chairs are utilized in
                the office and school, which have vertical forms and cause individuals to sit for long periods, creating
                back discomfort. Furthermore, some seats are of lower quality than the AI Ergonomic Chair, causing
                backaches and causing people to sit with their faces down, leading to scoliosis twisting. Many schools
                in Vietnam, for example, have employed these ordinary folding chairs for kids who do not sit properly.
                That is why we must investigate the various sorts of chairs available, ranging from business chairs to
                gaming chairs. However, everything always has many negative things. The office seats, for example, are
                tiny and rough, while the gaming and manager's chairs are made of leather, which does not absorb sweat
                properly.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">As a result, we've opted to employ the ergonomic chair, which
                has both pros and downsides. When individuals use an ergonomic chair, they get a large of benefits for
                themselves, such as a healthy workplace, which means that ergonomic chairs have a variety of health
                benefits, such as enhanced blood circulation and reduced mental and physical exhaustion. Along with the
                greater productivity that I have mentioned above, the ergonomic chair helps people have a heightened
                comfort level, supporting them to concentrate and do high-quality work. Besides that, this chair has
                some disadvantages that raise the likelihood of developing health problems related to a sedentary
                lifestyle. Users who are too short or tall and weigh more than the chairs are designed to hold may not
                use ergonomic chairs to their full potential. When using ill-fitting seats, such folks are bound to feel
                uncomfortable. According to those advantages and disadvantages, that is the reason my team has improved
                this chair by adding AI technology for people to avoid any issues. Hence, there are all things we have
                developed our product for people can use a better chair.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Currently, we are making the start-up investment to call for
                capital for the project. Because, in the estimate, this project will spend much money on improving AI
                technology, and our partnership has a discomposure in this term. However, we believe in our project,
                which will bring vastly outcomes based on their benefits effect on society. To attract investors, we are
                progressing an AI that can automatically be scanning the customers back, showing our ability to make
                this project coming reality.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">If we handed this project to other teams at the end of the
                semester, they would want to know how much the project spent, what technologies are used, and its
                purpose. </p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Roles</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">This is the role of each member in the project of
                COSC22083_Introduction to IT. Our group have four members and their role/tasks:</p>
            <ul style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p><strong>• Pham Vo Dong (s3891968): </strong> Dong has the position of Lead Developer, what it means
                    is the work as a manager that he has to check all tasks when we finish the process, which helps us
                    fix many issues by reading the report from the tester to know the situation of this project. That
                    will support our team and product very much to get many experiences and knowledge.</p>
                <p><strong>• Bui Quang Thanh Dat (s3827551): </strong>Technical Designer, which installs a chair with
                    sensor and A (Front End). That means he has to be responsible for the look and feel of a website and
                    the architecture of the user experience. When he wants to do his task carefully, he must fulfil
                    these objectives; the founders' front-end must have the primary features of three main languages:
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p><strong>• Bui Quang Thanh Dat (s3827551): </strong>): The role of Quan is an AI Developer that has to
                    develop AI technology in the chair (Back-end developer). A back-end developer creates and maintains
                    the technology that allows the user interface part to function. To enable communication between the
                    server, application, and database.</p>
                <p><strong>• Mai Chi Nghi (s3864219): </strong>My task on this project is to be a tester, and he is
                    testing the chair's operation to find some issues before generating them for markets. Besides that,
                    my roles are as a supporter and a reporter. He has to check our products carefully and write some
                    reports for Lead Developers, which helps us develop our products to serve our customers.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Scop and Limits</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">In 3 months, we cannot make a “true” AI chair with the
                personnel and fund we have, so our goal is to create a backrest that is connected to an AI that can
                switch between 2 to 3 preset modes depending on the data is recorded from the user when they sit on it.
                We made only the backrest since it is one of the essential but most crucial parts of the ergonomic
                chair, and it can show our project’s potential in how easy it is to see it change the user’s posture. We
                only do 2 to 3 preset modes due to the complexity of both AI programming and the settings we can produce
                with many moving parts; because of that, we settled for 2 or 3 preset modes as the option for the AI to
                decide to simplify the process while still accomplishing the goal of the prototype. We choose our goal
                because it can show both the basics and the potential of our project: A chair that records your physical
                data and analyze it to give you the best setting for your health and comfort. It can also serve as a
                baseline so we can make improvements since we can continue the project by building upon it by adding
                more moving parts to the chair for more flexible settings, updating the AI to increase its speed and
                accuracy and even making the AI able to flexibly change the details of the chair to fit the user best
                instead of restraining it to the preset setting. Since our goal is just a step on the roadmap we made
                (more detail in testing), if unknown risks or accidents affect our workflow, we can fall back to a stage
                that, while not as detailed, will still accomplice our goal of showing the basics of the project. In
                reverse, if we reach the goal before the deadline, we plan to make a more impressive prototype that will
                have more chances to attract investors.</p>

                in the right direction. The first test would be if the chair backrest would change setting with a
                computer command. After that is complete, the next test would be for the backrest to switch smoothly
                while a dummy sits on it. At the same time, the AI would be tested to see if it recognized the different
                heights of the sitter. The final test that we hope to reach is to connect the AI to the chair backrest
                and put another dummy on it to see if it can use the height of the dummy to switch between 2 to 3
                settings that we premade. The test would need the prototype product and 2 to 3 dummies with different
                sizes and will only need two computers and a minimum of 2 members to do. The final test is where we hope
                to reach before the deadline. If we get it early, we would add more premade settings to test the AI with
                a more diverse dummy and have a team member sit on it to give feedback on how smoothly the transition
                between stages was. With these tests, we would track our project based on the goals of completing these
                tests and make sure we are moving in the right direction. By the time the final test is complete, we
                will have a working AI backrest that can be used to showcase our potential to investors.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Ricks</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Like every project, there would be risks that we might meet
                while doing it; it would be best if we could identify them and plan to prevent them or deal with them
                and mitigate their damage. The first risk we identified is the difficulty of designing an AI, and we
                have to tackle this first since the project will need an AI that will work with high precision. Because
                developing an AI will not be an easy task, our solution to this problem is to give our AI engineer four
                weeks of researching in contrast to the 2 to 3 weeks that other members will have for their research.
                The second risk we might have to deal with is the safety issue when connecting the chair backrest with
                the AI. Because the prototype will not be wireless, there might be a risk of electric shock when used.
                To deal with this risk, we will check the backrest very carefully when we connect it to the AI and
                recheck it every time we test it. The third risk we thought about is the backrest working not as
                intended during the testing process, hurting the user; this would be a terrible thing to happen and
                should be avoided at all costs. Because of that, we will use a human-size dummy during all tests instead
                of a natural person; the real person test will only be done during the final weeks when we are sure the
                risk won’t happen.</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 28px;" data-aos="fade-up">Group processes and communcications</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Communication between group members is one of the most
                critical parts of our project and one of the elements that we have to consider first. Experience and
                some researches have shown that communication breakdowns between group members are the most common cause
                of project failures. Because of that, the first thing we do is find a time backrest where all members
                are free so the meetings can take place. After consideration, we have decided to have a weekly team
                meeting every Sunday afternoon and a quick appointment for progress checking every Thursday night aside
                from the time we spend at school after class. The team meeting is long and is usually for deciding plans
                based on the information and progress of the group or for the group to finish a part together. In
                contrast, the quick meeting is only 20 minutes max and is used to check everyone’s progress. We use
                Microsoft Teams for team meetings because we all have a Teams account link to our student number, and we
                all have experience using it. For a short discussion, we usually use messenger because of its ease of
                access. If a group member does not arrive at the meetings on time without reason, we will contact them
                on messenger first. Then we would call them using their phone number. If they do not answer, we will
                have to catch them up during the next meeting, and if they do not have a reason for their absence, they
                would be assigned to help other members with their job and their part. These decisions and rules are
                decided and agreed upon by team members in the first meeting to make sure everyone knows the rules and
                time.</p>
