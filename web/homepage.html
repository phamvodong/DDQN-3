            <h3 style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Group process:</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;" data-aos="fade-up">- Our team had a better connection than the previous
                assignment due to working together for long periods from assignment two to now. We are more flexible and
                professional in business; for example, all team members are familiar with working speed, so we are
                keeping up on the track, which smoothly operates the project. Moreover, we can use the git hub easier
                than before, making it easy to control the project. Consequently, we improved almost all our mistakes in
                the previous work, developing teamwork skills and connections. Therefore, we are becoming a better team.
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Career Plans:</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;" data-aos="fade-up">- Our team members' dream occupations are all quite diverse
                and have nothing in common except that they all include programming. Nghi aspires to be a security
                engineer, Dong to be an AI engineer, Dat to be a front-end developer, and Quan to be a back-end
                developer (in the form of a java programmer). With our team's different aims, there are both advantages
                and disadvantages. The disadvantages are that we will have a more difficult time discussing more
                specialized topics since our specialities are so dissimilar, and it will be more challenging to provide
                comments or assistance on a member's job because of this disparity. On the other hand, the advantages
                outweigh the disadvantages; our differences in experience allow us to provide feedback from different
                perspectives to advance our project. We can also cover various aspects of our project because other
                elements may require different specializations. Furthermore, working with people with varied backgrounds
                allows you to understand their occupations better and collaborate with others who do similar tasks in
                the future. We see this as an excellent chance to learn about the various disciplines of programming and
                how people with diverse backgrounds can collaborate to build a cohesive product. <br><br>
                - In addition, this project is an opportunity for each member to try a new role different from the dream
                job for having a unique experience that makes them improve themselves in the future. In the project,
                Dong becomes a head manager, letting Dong have an affair with appropriate with his test. After this
                project, he can learn how to become a good manager in the future. And with Quan, he is an AI developer
                who is familiar with his dream jobs which helps him more experience in the career path. Dat is a
                technical designer who works like a front-end developer and hardware engineer. Finally, Nghi is a tester
                which helps him practice his senses finding the problems and bugs in the product serving for his career
                working as a security engineer.

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">- The Git repository aids in the
                        organization of team progress by displaying all of the tasks that individuals are working on in
                        respective branches. Furthermore, the leader has easy control over colleagues' work; therefore,
                        the final result is uploaded into the main branch, which is more accurate and convenient.
                        Furthermore, we can work on a mobile device, ideal for those working online in the pandemic
                        period, when people do not allow face-to-face meetings to break the rule of not becoming sick.
                        Because we contacted GitHub through the previous assignment; thus, this repository is neater and
                        more logical than before.

                <p style="font-size: 20px;" data-aos="fade-up">- This project took a long time to develop in 6 months;
                    therefore, the numbers of the members in our teams in current time cannot make running the business
                    successful. Thus, we want to employ four positions in the marketing department who advertise our
                    product with potential customers and the following position that we shall hire:
                <ul style="font-size: 20px;" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <p><strong>• Receptionist:</strong> This is the essential position role in the project about the
                        product. As the business representative, a receptionist is the first person the customers will
                        meet in the company. In this position, we need extroverted people to talk with customers to
                        answer their questions, phones, and social media. Moreover, people who apply for this position
                        must know our product well for having the right advice for customers when they have a problem.

                        have the communication skills to keep guests entertained.</p>
                    <p><strong>• Marketing Manager: </strong>Marketing managers are in charge of developing and
                        implementing marketing campaigns to raise our brand awareness and increase sales. They create
                        marketing plans, manage marketing teams, write advertising contracts, and negotiate advertising
                        conditions are all part of the job description. To apply for this position, people need to have
                        a lot of soft skills like communication, creativity, collaboration, and some hard skills in the
                        marketing field. And we always appropriate people who have innovative thinking which brings
                        fresh air in our product marketing.</p>
                    <p><strong>•Graphic designer: </strong>This role will be responsible for the front-end developer who
                        will design the websites, apps, advertisements, and they will combine with the marketing manager
                        for the marketing online to bring our product overseas. The graphic designer might have

                        when working in the business environment.</p>
                    <p><strong>•Logistics: </strong>Because our project is about the chair, we need a factor responsible
                        for importing the component for installing the product and exporting the final product outside.
                        Therefore, we need professional knowledge of reading business documents, freight forwarding, and
                        running orders. Moreover, they must be good at foreign languages to communicate with foreign
                        cooperation, communicate, and control situations flexibly.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 30px" data-aos="fade-up">Group</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">Looking back to the previous assignment, we did very well
                    in working as a professional team in this assignment. That is the result of working together for a
                    long time, from assignment two to now. We are better at connecting all team members, and the
                    operational flow of each member has been improving day by day. During the period, we work as a team,
                    which makes us become a family where all members can come and feel comfortable when working. We have
                    a messenger group on Facebook for updating the project's status each day for other members to know,
                    and every week, we always spend our time meeting on the Microsoft teams; the average time of the
                    conference is from one hour to one a half hours. Because of being familiar with GitHub, we are
                    efficiently working in this platform (see Appendix 1); therefore, the graph of working flow grow up.
                    With each member in our team, they improve almost all the mistakes they make in the previous
                    assignment. Dat had developed the operational flow that he was committed to working on tasks faster
                    than before, Quan was very confident in his representation, Nghi's part was the most important in
                    the group process, and he did very well, which showed all the spirit of the project for the reader.
                    And the last one is Dong – leader of teams. He did very on the website of the group and the project
                    that was improved compared with the previous task. </p>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">The mistake is inevitable in the working because the time
                    of meeting for the presentation is not enough; therefore, we had a lot of errors in the presentation
                    we received after the presentation in class. For example, we missed the AI technology application in
                    the slide to be done more carefully in the future.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">However, we were surprised by the improvisation skills in
                    the presentation of all team members. They made the unreal project available and made an innovation
                    in our world, especially in health care.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">All members learn a lot of knowledge and essential skills
                    together in teams. Their teamwork skill had been improved during the period time of working as a
                    group.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">In the end, our GitHub log of activity is the same as the
                    complete picture of the puzzle with each member's work is a piece of the vital fragment. A photo
                    will not be complete without any component of the puzzle.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 30px" data-aos="fade-up">Bui Quang Thanh Dat</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">I think the thing that makes everyone worried is the
                    presentation itself, which we must present the idea briefly but concisely. Thankfully, we did a
                    rehearsal meeting which took about 48 minutes and 39 seconds, and we also planned to do another
                    rehearsal before the present day just to make sure. As we have covered the power point issue,
                    however the first rehearsal just not too well, I think so that the reason we have to do it again
                    another day, I am optimistic that it will achievable. Aside from that, we are working on is the
                    assignment 3, we need to provide insight on each aspect of the project. Personally, it’s useful to
                    research the project which open new ideas and knowledge regarding new technologies. For my part, I
                    was researching the Innovation part of the project, it helped me open my mind to new aspect of
                    technology. What surprises me was the PowerPoint in which the designing aspect and motion pictures
                    which I even thought it was a visual effect. The effect is so realistic and fascinating. I think my
                    GitHub log of activities contributing to the completion of the project, I worked on different pieces
                    of the puzzle and every other member filled up that puzzle.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 30px" data-aos="fade-up">Pham Vo Dong</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;" data-aos="fade-up">The role and responsibility in this project are the same
                    as with the ones I did before in the previous assignment, which is the teams' manager. And in this
                    assignment, I am self-aware of the excellent communication between us, which results from working
                    together for a long time. I was strongly confident to advise other team members and readily received
                    recommendations about my mistake, which made the project successful. Not only my soft skills
                    improving but also my technical skills about designing a website have increased during the time I
                    was doing the assignment because I had learned bootstrap throughout this period and found out more
                    extension libraries that serve for web development. However, this assignment helped me recognize my
                    mistake in managing the team. For example, I was hesitant to pick work roles in our group, making us
                    start slower. Honestly, I was amazed because all members kept me on the head chair of the teams
                    after I did in assignment two, which was not as I expected. Moreover, I learned a lot of things from
                    my teammate, especially the representation skill because each member had a unique style of
                    representation that created their personalities. I learned from that to improve my confidence in
                    talking before the crowd. About my GitHub log of activity is one piece of Lego to build a project
                    which is essential equally with other members in the team.</p>
