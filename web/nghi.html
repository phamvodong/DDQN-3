                        <li data-aos="fade-up">I was born and raised in Binh Duong, Vietnam, and graduated from high
                            school two years ago with the ability to speak in two languages: Vietnamese and English. In
                            2019, I began my studies at RMIT University. I'm pursuing a bachelor’s in information
                            technology by taking an English course. Aside from that, I am a member of the Flag Football
                            Club (FFC) at university, and in my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and going to
                            coffee shops with my friends. The globe is expanding at a breakneck speed these days. In
                            many ways, technology has infiltrated and affected our everyday lives, thus it's reasonable
                            to claim that IT has made our lives easier. We may now buy, learn, and work all from the
                            comfort of our own homes. Smartphones, PCs, and laptops can be used to carry out these
                            tasks. Because of COVID-19, my friends and I have been studying IT online since 2020, but we
                            have to return to school face-to-face in less weeks, which helps us improve teamwork skills
                            more and more. As a result, I made the decision to expand my education in order to benefit
                            myself in the future.</li>

                            From my current experience, qualifications and skills are careful at work when I work on the
                            team by checking after each step that my teammate did the deadline, which takes me 3 years
                            or more. This knowledge will help us fix many problems, which we have to confront during
                            group work. Due diligence makes it possible for me to see each member is issue in the team,
                            then each person has to give suggestions on the solution and explain why they have those
                            issues to learn from and improve their skills to work better in the future.
